# Sunnyside Landing Page
This is a solution to the [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## My Process
- I decided to develop this simple page to practice styling with Sass. The only functionality I needed to add was the button that toggles the navigation bar in the mobile layout.
- To keep the design responsive I added more breakpoints than usual for certain elements.
- Deployed to Github Pages.

## ðŸ”§ Built With
- Create React App
